Priced to sell at $749,000

If you are in the market for a gorgeous three bedroom traditional character colonial home with all the modern features in the wonderful inner city suburb of Greenslopes then you will be hard pressed to go past this one. Not only for value for money but for how tastefully this house has been renovated and extended. It has been extended to more than double the original size and is a credit to the current owner.

This property is situated on a low maintenance 410m2 block in the heart of Greenslopes and is close to all amenities.

Features include:

UPSTAIRS

*  Open plan living areas
*  Three good sized bedrooms with the master bedroom featuring a large ensuite and walk in robe
*  Private front verandah
*  Large lounge room opening onto a rear deck through bi-folding doors
*  Beautiful timber joinery throughout
*  Lovely polished floors to the living areas and carpets to the bedrooms
*  Sensational kitchen with marble bench tops and top quality stainless steel appliances
*  Ducted reverse cycle air conditioning throughout

DOWNSTAIRS

*  Beautiful internal timber stairs
*  Large separate laundry and third toilet
*  An area that could be built in to accommodate a home office
*  Remote controlled tandem garage
*  A massive area underneath the extended part of the home to further enclose or an area that could be used as a private entertaining area. The choice is yours.

This is truly a â€œmust inspect propertyâ€ and I urge you to come along to our open for inspection.
