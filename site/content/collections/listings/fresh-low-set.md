Privately set back from leafy Gregory Street, this low-set family home welcomes you with its lovely street appeal. Stepping inside, you will find yourself in a lovely sitting room or study area reminiscent of a Spanish Villa with its textured walls and cool tiled flooring. It is easy to imagine kicking back with a coffee and a good book. The air conditioned lounge and dining area feature lovely white tongue and groove timber walls contrasting to the beautiful timber flooring.

Modern roller blinds provide privacy when you want to shut the world away. Flowing through from the living area is kitchen with plenty of bench space and storage, perfect for the entertainer.
