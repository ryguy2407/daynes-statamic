Firstly we have the fully renovated three bedroom house at front of the property which has been tastefully done. Brand new kitchen with new stainless steel appliances, a new bathroom, polished timber hardwood floors which look an absolute treat. Totally repainted internally. The property is totally fenced with a remote electric gate for additional security.

To the rear of the property sits a very large shed which was erected and purposely built into a one bedroom dwelling. It has been fitted out like a new home internally and is totally air conditioned and insulated. It has a home theatre in the lounge with its own projector mounted from the ceiling and remote control pull down screen. It has tiles throughout and has been tastefully decorated.

This opportunity would suit someone that has an elderly parent or parents that want them to live with them but at the same time have their own space. Take your pick which dwelling they live in. It may be the case that you and your partner live in the rear dwelling and rent the front house out for $360pw to assist with the mortgage or just simply rent both out and have a return of approximately $700pw as an investment property. Plenty of options here!
