This charming family home has beautiful character, and is a home to be truly proud of. Stepping inside from the inviting front deck, you are welcomed into the light and airy home. The living area beckons you in with the lovely Hampton's colour scheme of grey walls, white trim and lovely timber floors. A delightful wood heater conjures up images of sitting in the warmth on a winter's evening with a cup of cocoa. Lovely double french doors open from the living area onto the back deck.

To the right of the living room, through fresh white double doors, you will find bedroom 2, equipped with a built in robe and two windows. Next to this room you will find bedroom 3 again equipped with a built in robe. This room also has a ceiling fan and double french doors opening onto the deck. There are also two windows, giving an abundance of light.

The kitchen is roomy, with plenty of bench space and a built in pantry. There is a laundry stepping off from the kitchen.

The bathroom has a shower over the bath, and again plenty of light. To the front of the home you will find bedroom 1. This room has a built in robe, ceiling fan and boasts three windows.

The property is fenced. The driveway leads to a garage at the rear of the property and a quaint old outdoor 'dunny' sits as proud as punch in the yard. It can be used for storage and makes a charming feature and great conversation piece.

The back deck is a lovely bonus to this property, partially covered by shade cloth and plenty of room to entertain.

The property is within comfortable walking distance to Banoon train station.
