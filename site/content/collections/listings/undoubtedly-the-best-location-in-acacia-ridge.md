Please donâ€™t take my word for it because I want you to come and see for yourself as this is truly a superb location. In my opinion the best in Acacia Ridge but I want you to be the judge.

This home is situated on a large elevated 809sqm block with a 20 metre frontage (this makes it sub-dividable). It is surrounded by council parkland on three sides of the property, therefore only one neighbour which really gives it that rural feel.

Great views all round and the owners tell me that since it is so elevated they are treated by wonderful sunsets.

This three bedroom home is of a split level design and is constructed of chamfer board with an iron roof.

Features include;
*  3 bedrooms all air conditioned
*  Lounge room is also air conditioned with a ceiling fan
*  Beautiful polished hardwood timber floors throughout
*  Extended dining room to the rear of the kitchen
*  A large timber deck leading off the dining room for the entertainer
*  Underneath the house is a one car garage with the rest of the area used for storage which is totally lockable
*  A one and a half undercover length carport to the side
*  Lovely landscaped garden with a large cubby house for the kids
*  Totally fenced which makes it child and pet friendly
*  5000ltr water tank
*  Gas hot water
*  Security bars and fly screens to most windows
*  Recently repainted externally and partially internally
*  Close to all amenities and public transport
*  Approx 17 kms to the CBD

Priced to sell for the best offer over $380,000
