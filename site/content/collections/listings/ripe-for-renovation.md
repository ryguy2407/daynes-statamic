Here we have a large four bedroom post war home on a 658sqm block. Under the carpets you have beautiful hardwood floors that can be polished and turned into a real feature of the home. The interior walls and ceilings do require painting but this is quite an easy way to add value.

Many years ago they removed and relocated the existing back stairs and extended an area to the rear of the home which they now use as a dining room. It also has a separate bathroom and toilet.

Underneath the house has a massive storage area that is also lockable. The home comes with a swimming pool with decking and a privacy screen to one side. Off street parking for 4 cars and a double carport. It is totally fenced which makes it child and pet friendly.

It is close to all amenities including public transport.

The owner has priced this very realistically at $429,000 for a quick sale. Inspection by appointment.
