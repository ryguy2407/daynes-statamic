This welcoming and gracious family home promises the new lucky owners the very best in convenience and lifestyle. Sweeping lawns front the property which has been finished with a neutral render and stylishly complemented by treated timber accents, all giving this property great street appeal. What cannot be seen from the outside, however, are the generously proportioned internal spaces with lofty ceilings and beautiful finishes.

Stepping through the front door, you are welcomed by sophisticated and cool interiors, with stylish flooring and neutral colours on the walls. The entry hall flows graciously through to the main living spaces and arrives at the kitchen, and further to the shady outdoor entertaining area. Privately set to the rear of the home, the open concept living spaces have a modern and contemporary feel, with glossy floor tiles and a neutral colour scheme. The generous open-plan kitchen with glossy benchtops overlooks the open plan family and dining space, and beyond to the back patio. Each of these well-appointed spaces are perfect for those who entertain and enjoy relaxing with family, both inside and out. Immediately off the hall is a tiled and spacious living room, with the possibility to be utilised as a media room, study or home office.

Each of the four bedrooms include air conditioning and built-in storage, with the large master suite serviced by a lovely ensuite and walk in wardrobe. Designed for families, the beautifully presented main bathroom provides two way access to one of the bedrooms and twin basins.
