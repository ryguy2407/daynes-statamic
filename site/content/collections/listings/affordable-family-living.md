The main living space converges with the outdoor area inviting family living and entertaining.There are two separate and very private undercover entertaining areas. The outdoor patio is perfect for those Australia Day BBQs, great for entertaining or leisurely activity. The property also backs onto a private bushland acreage providing a peaceful outlook and natural backdrop to the outdoor space. The backyard is fully fenced and there is ample room for the children and family pets to play. The backyard would also be perfectly suited for a future pool, should this be on your property wish list.
