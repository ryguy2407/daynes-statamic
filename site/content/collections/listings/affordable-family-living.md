The front garden is well-maintained and provides a welcoming entry that is reflective of the high level of care that has been taken with this home. Designed with flexible family living in mind, this home offers open plan living throughout.The kitchen ties together both living areas allowing it to be a central part of the house.

The main living space converges with the outdoor area inviting family living and entertaining.There are two separate and very private undercover entertaining areas. The outdoor patio is perfect for those Australia Day BBQs, great for entertaining or leisurely activity. The property also backs onto a private bushland acreage providing a peaceful outlook and natural backdrop to the outdoor space. The backyard is fully fenced and there is ample room for the children and family pets to play. The backyard would also be perfectly suited for a future pool, should this be on your property wish list.

Along with 2 living areas, this home offers 4 bedrooms with ceiling fans in each. The Master bedroom offers air conditioning with its own ensuite. Another bathroom is perfectly situated near the kitchen and both living areas.
