Set amongst the trees, this split-level family home is unique in its location with only one neighbouring property. Backing on to parkland and overlooking nature reserve beyond, it is hard to believe the home is only 16km from the Brisbane CBD. This property is a much sought-after 809sqm block, meaning a generous parcel of land for a family to enjoy, build a granny flat or extension, or an attractive investment opportunity for those seeking a subdivision project (subject to council approval). Situated in one of the most elevated parts of the suburb, the views are second to none at sunset. The picturesque setting make it all the more attractive for each option presented by this investment.

The home is of attractive chamfer board construction and unique design. A thoughtful, split level design with the three bedrooms separate from living and kitchen, meaning the perfect home for busy families needing functionality and privacy. The kitchen is partially open to a lovely dining space which makes the most of leafy, elevated outlook. Ideal for entertaining, this dining space flows out to the shady timber deck stepping straight out to the gently sloping backyard. In the yard is a great shed or even children's cubby house, with a cute timber porch to the front. In all, this is a value-packed and future-proof investment for those looking for their next renovation project.

This property features:

*  Beautiful polished hardwood timber floors throughout
*  Three good-sized bedrooms all air conditioned
*  Living room air conditioned with a ceiling fan
*  Extended dining room to the rear of the kitchen
*  A large timber deck leading off the dining room for the entertainer
*  Lockable single car garage under house
*  Plenty of storage space under house
*  Under cover carport to the side of the property, with extra length
*  Lovely landscaped garden with a large cubby house for the kids
*  5000L water tank
*  Gas hot water
*  Security bars and fly screens to most windows
*  Recently repainted externally and partially internally
*  809sqm fully fenced block, perfect for children and pets

Situated in one of the most tranquil and leafy pockets of Acacia Ridge, this property is sure to tick all the boxes for the savvy investor. Not only is it a great potential first home for those planning for their family, it is also an amazing opportunity to sit on a rare large block of sub-dividable land so close to the Brisbane CBD. Convenient to Elizabeth Street shopping centre and the larger Beaudesert Road shopping complex which includes both Woolworths and Aldi.
