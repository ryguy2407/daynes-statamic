This home would either suit a large family or alternatively as an investment property aimed at student accommodation.

The current owner of this property bought this home in January 2009 and decided to renovate it so he and his family had a wonderful abode to live in. No expense was spared and the renovations were carried out with top of the range fixtures and fittings. The ownerâ€™s plans have since changed and he is now offering it for sale due to another business opportunity.

There is much more that this property has to offer and the only way you can totally appreciate it is to contact me for a private inspection.
