Sitting pretty behind the white picket fence is this original post-war home typical for the area, in immaculate condition. The chamferboard exterior is offset by lovely casement windows and a tiled roof. Stepping off the lovely east-facing patio, the open-plan living a dining is perfect for accommodating busy families in a warm and inviting space. Stepping through to the kitchen, one is presented a functional and fresh room with upgraded cabinetry and low-maintenance lino flooring. The four bedrooms are well proportioned and full of light, the bathroom is equally serviceable for families. All up, this home represents an opportunity to become a home or investment, renovated or as is.

Yeronga is one of a few Brisbane suburbs which can truly offer it all, an inner city location and a picturesque, safe place to call home. From an accessibility perspective, it is accessible from a number of major arterial roads allowing easy commutes into and away from the CBD. It is convenient to many public and private amenities. The closest hospital is the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Woolloongabba and it is not much further to Greenslopes Private Hospital. A train station is located in the suburb and plenty of bus routes heading to the university and the city are available to residents. The suburb is serviced by two primary schools and one high school, with only a short distance to a range of elite private high schools. It is also close to the University of Queensland across the river at St Lucia, which is accessible via the City Cat or Green Bridge bus service at Dutton Park. The closest shopping hub is Fairfield Gardens, recently renovated and with a fantastic offering of shops and supermarkets. Also nearby is the boutique Yeronga Village with award-winning butchers, green grocers, bakeries and restaurants. Yeronga itself is a picturesque suburb with expanses of parkland, bike paths and of course tracts of greenery along the Brisbane River.
