This neat low-set property is your chance to secure a classic piece of mid-century design. Situated on a generous 622sqm block, this home has lovely street appeal with the striking sloped roof and tidy brick fence. The cute front patio opens off the living area and provides privacy from the street. Inside, the generous open plan living and dining flows through to the original kitchen. The kitchen, while dated, is functional and showcases the classic cabinetry. The backdoor off the kitchen leads through to the laundry and into the yard beyond. With its built in barbeque and sweeping lawns, the yard will be the delight of families with children and pets alike.

Three good sized bedrooms plus an additional utility room make this home larger than most in the area. This additional room would be perfect as a study or rumpus. Carpets and lino throughout hide the hardwood timber floors for which these properties are much sought-after. This home is almost completely original and does require cosmetic improvements. However, those with an eye for a good investment will see the potential of this property.

This property features:

*  Classic mid-century design, blank slate original condition
*  Open plan living, dining and kitchen
*  Three good sized bedrooms, plus additional utility room which could be used as an additional bedroom or study
*  Near new zincalume roof
*  Carport allows for internal access, a real convenience for busy families
*  Well maintained block, perfect for children and pets

The Acacia Market Place includes Woolworths and Aldi in addition to a great range of boutique shops. Convenient to the great primary schools the area has to offer including Acacia Ridge State School and St Fatimaâ€™s Primary School, in addition to daycares and childcare options.
