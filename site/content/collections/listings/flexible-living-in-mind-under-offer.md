This lovely two story brick and tile home is conveniently positioned in the heart of Algester.
The house itself backs onto Timberland Park - a rarity in Algester. Well maintained, it has been designed with flexible living in mind and would suit any family or professional couples.
Express bus to the CBD, Algester State School and the Algester Sports complex are all only a short walk away.

A generous sized bedroom on the first floor would be a perfect teenager retreat with a separate study area. Just the same, it would suit a work-from-home professional with plenty of space for a professional outfit. This coupled with a separate living space, a study area which opens to the backyard is complete with a newly renovated bathroom, all on the first floor!

The spacious open plan living area on the second floor opens onto a newly enclosed sun room area to extend your living space. The kitchen and dining area both overlook Timberland Park for alfresco dining. In Addition to an entire built in first floor, there are 3 generous sized bedrooms, all with built-in wardrobes on the top floor.

Even with all which this property offers, there is still plenty of potential to put your very own finishing touches.
