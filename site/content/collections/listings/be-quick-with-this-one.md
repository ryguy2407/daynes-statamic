This property's established gardens will be sure to win your hearts over. Situated on a 701sqm corner block and very secluded from the road due to the beautiful vegetation in the front yard.

The home comprises of three generously sized bedrooms with the master bedroom having a built in robe. Its construction is chamfer board external walls with an iron roof. Timber hardwood floors throughout with relatively new carpet to the bedrooms. The home has security bars to all windows and doors and timber blinds to the lounge and dining rooms. The kitchen and bathroom do require attention.

A real feature of the home is the large fenced backyard offering a safe environment for the kids. Again, like the front yard it is treed and offers plenty of shade but also enough room for a pool or a game of backyard cricket. It comes with a large garden shed and double carport with lockable gates.

Located close to all amenities including shops, parks, Acacia Ridge State School and Souths Sports Club. A bus stop is situated about 25 metres away.

This property is priced to sell this Saturday at the Open For Inspection between 10.00 - 10.30am.
