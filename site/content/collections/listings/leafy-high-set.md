This lovely high-set home is ready and waiting for renovation. Neatly presented and highly functional as is, this is a great opportunity for owner occupiers to move straight in and realise their renovation dreams at their own pace. Situated in a quiet, elevated pocket of Acacia Ridge and surrounded by mature trees and neat gardens, this property has great street appeal. This home is a great example of classic mid-century design and quality construction. Original homes in the area are much sought after for their solid timber frames and flooring, and renowned for the ease at which they can be transformed into a retreat to suit the modern lifestyle.

This home has been partially updated and features fresh laminate flooring over the original timbers. A low maintenance and light-coloured finish, the flooring is great to suit a modern colour palette. The kitchen and bathroom are dated but clean and tidy, requiring only cosmetic upgrades to cabinetry and fixtures. For those seeking a sleek, open plan design, these homes are also lovely where the kitchen has been opened up to join the living area. The options really are limitless. The kitchen opens out to the lovely under cover paved entertaining area, overlooking the leafy backyard. This space has really taken advantage of the gently sloping block and steps out directly onto the grass, perfect for children. The value does not end here, with generous enclosed spaces under the house. The high-set design has meant that a double car garage, storage or workshop area, and laundry can be accommodated.

This property features:

*  Classic mid-century design, solid construction and high-set
*  Upgraded kitchen with timber-look cabinetry and electric stove
*  Kitchen opens out through sliding doors to shady back patio
