This immaculately preserved property is your chance to secure a classic piece of mid-century design. Like stepping into a time capsule, this home is a beautiful example of the era and the perfect compliment to modern living and design sensibilities. For those who love the current trend for modern, Scandinavian inspired design, the open plan living and dining with the battened feature divide would provide the perfect backdrop to furniture and finishings with this aesthetic. Retaining the timber panelled walls would complete the mid-century look, but would be equally stylish with a coat of paint in a neutral tone. The living space is also a showcase of the hardwood timber flooring, for which homes of this era are much sought after. These floors are throughout the remainder of the home, protected by lino and would be simply stunning once revealed. Because if its immaculate preservation, this investment gives the lucky future owners plenty of options, many of which could be achieved relatively inexpensively.

Privately tucked away from the street behind beautifully maintained gardens, the block slopes gently down to the parkland at the rear. The leafy outlooks and tranquil surrounds make this an ideal family home; it is easy to imagine children enjoying the direct access to Merchiston Street Park as an extension to their own grassy backyard! Three good sized bedrooms plus an additional storage room make this home larger than most in the area. The bathroom and kitchen retain their original fittings and cabinetry, but neatly presented and highly functional as is. This much loved property is ready and waiting for its next chapter, giving an opportunity for someone to create the next generation of happy memories.

This property features:

*  Leafy position, backing onto parkland and a short walk to Norma Croaker Park
*  Generous block with mature trees, well maintained gardens and plenty of grassy lawn to enjoy
