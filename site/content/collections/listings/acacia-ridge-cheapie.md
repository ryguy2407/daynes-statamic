If you are into renovating or prepared to renovate then this one may be for you.

Situated in Larbert Street on a 607m2 level block this home is built from solid brick with a restored roof. It has three bedrooms and has a large area underneath for cars and storage. Hardwood timber floors throughout.

There is not much more I can tell you as you really need to have a look for yourself.

Located close to all amenities including shops, parks, buses, Acacia Ridge State School and Souths Sports Club.

Inspection by appointment.
