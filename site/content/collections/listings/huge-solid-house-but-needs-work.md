This huge brick and tile home in this quiet pocket of Acacia Ridge situated on a 546m2 block is in need of an internal renovation. Originally built in the mid 1980's it features 4 bedrooms upstairs with separate lounge and dining room.

It has a reasonably sized balcony at the front leading off the lounge room.  Downstairs it has a large rumpus room with 2 additional utility rooms that could be used as offices or just simple additional storage areas. Second toilet also downstairs.

It has a DLUG with a very large workshop to the rear. Plenty of storage areas with plenty of room and has a good sized laundry. Backyard is fenced so is child and pet friendly.

The owners accept that this home needs money spent and this is reflected in the price. They have listed it for a very conservative $359,000 for a reasonably quick sale but there is no further room to move on the listed price.

Located close to all amenities including shops, parks, Acacia Ridge State School and Souths Sports Club. Bus Stops are also close by.
