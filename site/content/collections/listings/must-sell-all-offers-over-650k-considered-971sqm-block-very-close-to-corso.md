This big, beautiful, treed block is in a quiet street, only 85 metres from a kilometre of parkland stretching north along the Brisbane River and situated adjacent to the most prestigious area of the Yeronga Corso where multi-million dollar houses underpin strong future property values.

At 971 sq metres the property is big enough to split into two blocks but because of its shape it would come under the heading of ‘impact accessible’ or ‘code notifiable’. Therefore City Council approval would not be guaranteed.

However, for someone wanting to establish a large, long term family residence, the property is a rare opportunity. Block size, the tone of nearby developments and position relative to the city and university, put this opportunity in the ‘limited availability’ category.

The existing four bedroom house while sound and liveable, demands removal to allow the development of the block to its potential, with the construction of a significant ‘statement’ residence.

The owner is committed to an overseas position and has to sell this property.
