This cute three bedroom cottage is conveniently situated in Acacia Ridge, on a 728sqm Low Medium Residential (LMR) zoned block. This is a great opportunity to secure a generous single allotment of land in one of Brisbaneâ€™s most rapidly developing areas. With a 21.8m frontage, this property represents an array of short and long term investment options subject to council approval. For those interested, a property developers report can be made available at request. Should you choose to hold the land and develop later, the house itself holds the potential to become a tidy rental with good return. With hardwood timber floors throughout and a good layout for families, the home itself only needs cosmetic upgrades to become a highly liveable property.
