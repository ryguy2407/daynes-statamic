This home was one of the last to be built in this relatively modern estate in 1998. The original owners have resided there all this time and are reluctantly offering it for sale as they are moving south to their farm.

The home is situated on one of the larger blocks in the estate boasting 500sqm and situated on a corner. The property is fully fenced and is child and pet friendly.

Other features include;
*  Three good sized bedrooms with built ins
*  Solid brick and tile construction
*  Open plan living
*  Master bedroom features an ensuite
*  Home office or could be used as a fourth bedroom
*  The home office has separate access which is great if you wish to bring clients to your home without entering in through the front door and disturbing other members of the family
*  Large living/lounge area which has reverse cycle air conditioning
*  Modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances
*  Another real plus to this home is that it has two separate outdoor living areas which are under cover and feature transparent pull down weather curtains similar to those in a caf and a built in BBQ
*  Full security/fly screens throughout
*  Custom made timber blinds
*  Double lock up garage with remote control
*  Fully insulated throughout
*  Lounge has a timber floating floor with tiles to the dining and walkways
*  It has a large park across the road were the kids can go and kick a footy
