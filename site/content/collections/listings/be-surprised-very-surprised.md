Richlands Investment Opportunity

SLASHED FROM $895,000 TO $799,000

You would never know from looking from the road that you would have an absolute investment gem here.

Here we have five dwellings comprising of four one bedroom units at the front of the property and the fifth is like a large family home at the rear. The construction of the property is solid brick with an iron roof built about 45 years ago. The total land area is a huge 1,962m2 with a gentle slope to the road.

The four one bedroom units are all approximately 50m2 in size and have been semi renovated with new kitchen tops, tiles to the floor including bathroom tiles and repainted throughout. They all have a good sized living area and bedroom.

Unit five is approximately 220-230m2 in size comprising of 4 bedrooms and a study. The master bedroom has WIR and ensuite. It has a large lounge and a large family room with a pot belly stove. The kitchen is totally renovated with 2 pak cupboards and thick granite bench tops. It offers stainless steel appliances and heaps of cupboard space. It has a large laundry with plenty of storage space. It has a separate toilet from the bathroom which both have been refurbished. There are 3 air conditioning units within the dwelling. Lovely ceramic floor tiles throughout the living areas and the bedrooms. Security and fly screens throughout also.

The property is fully fenced with lockable gates for Unit 5 so it is very child and pet friendly.

Current income is $48,600pa. Rates approximately $760 per quarter and Urban Utilities is approximately $850 per quarter.

Very high occupancy rate for many years.

Close to all amenities with easy access to Ipswich Motorway.

You have a couple of choices here;

1. Live in Unit 5 which is very comfortable to live in and oversee/manage your own rentals and receive $585pw or $30,400pa or;

2. Rent the whole complex out as it is now with a rental return of $48,600pa or;

3. Strata Title these units and sell them off individually when you wish. This has been investigated and can be done for a very minimal fee. I would be more than happy to give you the name of the Town Planner who quoted this and could do this for you at a very reasonable rate.
