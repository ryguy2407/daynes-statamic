Several options here, preliminary drawings for potential sub-division either to move and keep the existing house then sub dividing the land into 8 residential blocks ranging from 584sqm to 629sqm which would leave the existing dwelling on 943sqm.

Alternatively retain the house and swimming pool on a 2245sqm block with two lots of 455sqm and 2 lots at 1315sqm with two street access.

Or you could just enjoy living on acerage with one acre separately fenced perfect for livestock. The house consists of 5 bedrooms with ensuite and air conditioning to the main bedroom, all other bedrooms are equipped with ceiling fans and separate bathroom and toilet upstairs. Air conditioning to the loungeroom / dining and a large functional kitchen.

Downstairs is a large rumpus room with separate toilet, a great undercover entertaining area which overlooks the inviting inground pool which has it's own change room and pool filter room.

There is ample car spaces and this is one for the guys at 12,000sq foot shed!

Please contact Adrian Daynes on 3892 4844 or anytime on 0411 729 484 to arrange and inspection of the property and preliminary plans.
