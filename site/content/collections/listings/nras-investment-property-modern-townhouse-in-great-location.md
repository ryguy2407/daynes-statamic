This modern townhouse is beautifully presented with high quality finishes and fixtures, promising excellent future returns for the savvy investor. This property is leased through the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS). Over a period of ten years, NRAS was designed to provide financial incentives to investors and was designed to encourage the supply of affordable housing.

Less than two years into the 10 year NRAS scheme, this investment offers approximately a further 8 plus years of benefits from the scheme. This equates to over $80,000 of TAX FREE incentives but has now been discontinued by the government. Please contact me for any queries you may have about NRAS.
