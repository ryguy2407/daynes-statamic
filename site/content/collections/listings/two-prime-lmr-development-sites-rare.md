36 Elizabeth Street & 23 Amherst Street, Acacia Ridge

Here is your chance to buy one or both of these sensational development sites. Situated right in the hub of Acacia Ridge, these properties are less than 100 metres to Elizabeth Street Shopping Centre and bus stop. Also close to schools, parks, childcare and medical centres.

Both sites are 825sqm totaling 1,650sqm with approximately 16.5m frontages. The site is flat making it an easy build. As the properties are back-to-back, drive through access is achievable.

Both properties have three bedroom homes in good condition returning $330 and $340 per week. Rental demand in the area is high as it services a vast commercial/industrial area including Archerfield Airport.
