Acreage In Greenbank - Close to all Amenities

Situated on 5341sqm in Greenbank at the end of a cul-de-sac, this spacious lowset brick veneer home would suit anyone who likes to enjoy their space and privacy whilst still being close distances to all amenities.

The house features four spacious bedrooms, a large rumpus room, roomy kitchen and meals area and a separate living/dining area with a large built-in fireplace. Also on the property is a large attractive saltwater swimming pool with additional spa.

The property is in the most elevated section in the estate, being on top of a ridge that runs through the area. Facing north, it catches breezes that sweep through the area almost daily, making living in it very comfortable, particularly in summer.

Being at the end of a cul-de-sac, it has a gently sloping private back yard which is devoid of any water run off problems regardless of the volume of any heavy downpours.

Whilst the property is serviced by town water, it also is equipped with an artesian bore which is an abundant source of water even when town water restrictions are applying.

Park Ridge shopping centre which includes Woolworths is less then five minutes away,

The largest shopping centre in the area, "Grand Plaza" is approximately a 6 minute drive away.

The Greenbank RSL (the largest in Australia - which has approximately 165,000 members) is only about a five minute drive.

Primary and secondary schools are within walking distance.

Beaudesert Road (Mount Lindsay Highway) is the main arterial Road to the Elizabeth Park estate where the property is situated. This road is currently being widened into a four lane highway the building of a fly-over for which is now in progress.

Part of the new highway development, is a bus terminal and car park which will enable you to catch the bus directly to Brisbane City.

This will also make traveling to Brisbane city and the Gold Coast a shorter trip time wise, being 25 and 35 minutes drive respectively.

Acreages this close to the city will soon be a thing of the past.

Offers over $530,000.
