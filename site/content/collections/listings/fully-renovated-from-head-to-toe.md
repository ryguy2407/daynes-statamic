Here we have a fully renovated solid brick highset home on a 607m2 block in a very quiet cul-de-sac. It features three bedrooms with a further room which could be used as a single bedroom or office/study. It has lovely French doors leading out from the lounge room to a brand new north-east facing deck.

This home has been totally gutted with all plaster boards and ceilings now replaced. The old asbestos roof has been removed to make way for a new colorbond roof.

The kitchen now boasts stainless steel appliances and the bathroom is now equipped with all modern fittings. A full internal paint has been done with new doors and door handles. The owner had the hardwood floors water blasted from underneath to remove every speck of grime and dirt, then totally sanded back and polished on top. The floors have come up absolutely magic. The home has also been totally re-plumbed and rewired.

The downstairs area really adds significant value to this property. The double garage has brand new tilt doors, springs and hinges. The laundry boasts an over sized hot water system. It has an enclosed workshop and another enclosed room for storage. The garage walls and floor have been painted which really brightens up the area. Plenty of space here.

A new concrete driveway has been laid with retaining walls and a brick wall to the front of the property.

It is basically situated next door to the Acacia Ridge State School so the kids donâ€™t need to be taken by car. Buses and public transport close by as are shopping centres and other amenities.

This home is truly great value for money. Absolutely nothing to do here. Come check it out!
