This low-maintenance home has been beautifully updated and finished in a neutral colour scheme. The tiled from patio overlooks the neat front yard with fruit trees and grassy lawns, which surrounds around the property.

Flowing through to the galley-style kitchen, the main areas of the home are both stylish and functional. The kitchen features plenty of storage and stainless steel appliances. Conveniently, the laundry is situated just beyond the kitchen and provides access to the yard. The bedrooms are situated privately to the rear of the home and each has been equipped with storage, a ceiling fan and an air conditioner.
