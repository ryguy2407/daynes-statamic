This brick and tile lowset home offers three good sized bedrooms and a home office which could be used as a fourth bedroom. It is only 10 years young and has been kept in tip top condition from the previous two owners. It is situated in a quiet pocket of this relatively new estate on 403m2 of land. It has ducted air conditioning throughout which is very desirable with the hot summer months ahead of us.

Other features include;
*  Carpet to the bedrooms and lounge with tiles to the living areas and hallway
*  Ensuite to master bedroom
*  Single lock up garage with an additional gated area for another vehicle or trailer
*  Totally fenced back yard
*  Fully under covered entertaining area
*  Established gardens
*  Fly and security screens throughout
