This home is sure to impress with its leafy outlook and ample space for entertaining. Situated in an elevated position ideal to make the most of this peaceful pocket of Acacia Ridge, this home has been thoughtfully designed. Most striking about the property is the sweeping front veranda. Giving the home great street appeal and providing privacy for the interiors, this space is sure to become the focus for all family gatherings and relaxation. Inside, the polished timber floors throughout give the property a clean, low maintenance finish, much sought after to complement busy lives. In keeping with the low maintenance ideal, is the kitchen, which has been finished in a durable stainless steel. Easy to care for and providing a sleek, modern aesthetic, the stainless steel kitchen is truly a delight for those who love to cook and entertain.

The internal layout of the home is simple and makes the most of the spaces. The kitchen is open to the living and dining through a doorway and breakfast bar. This provides enough of an opening to allow the flow of light and space. The living and dining open out to the front verandah through the front door, and renovators will see the potential to really make a feature of this flow of space with custom doors in place of the window. As it is, this is a highly serviceable and comfortable arrangement of internal and complementary external spaces. Each of the bedrooms is generously proportioned and situated privately down a single hallway to the sunny northern side of the home. This is a property full of potential for those keen-eyed renovators and savvy investors.
