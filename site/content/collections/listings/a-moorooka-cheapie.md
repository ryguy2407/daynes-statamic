First Home Owners or Investors dont delay.

Here is a beauty for all those people that like to do a bit of renovating.

Situated in one of Moorookas best known streets is this two bedroom unit that is tired internally and requires a good makeover. Replace the kitchen, bathroom, a new tiled floor and an internal paint would add so much value to the property without breaking the bank. The good news is that this one is on the ground floor and has no steps or stairs. The complex of 4 units is constructed of cavity brick and an iron roof that was replaced about 5 years ago and has its own lock up garage.

The other great benefit this unit has to offer is its location as it is walking distance to the Woolies Shopping Centre, Moorooka Shopping Centre precinct, Moorooka Sports and Community Club, The Roosters AFL Footy Club and Moorooka State School to mention just a few. Bus stops in the next street on Mayfield Road.

Body Corporate Fees: $505.13 per quarter (approx)

Come see for yourself. Open for Inspection Saturday 11.00-11.30am
