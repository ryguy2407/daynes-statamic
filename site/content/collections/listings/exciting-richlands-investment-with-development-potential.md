This recently renovated two-bedroom family home boasts a fresh kitchen, bathroom and lovely living and entertaining spaces. To the rear of the property is an un-renovated large, freestanding, fully self-contained granny flat of similar construction to the main house. This is an ideal property for growing families and investors alike, with plenty of exciting opportunities to capitalise on your investment.

This is a solid home with cavity brick internal walls and iron roof. Situated on a 607sqm LMR zoned block, this property also represents an exciting investment in the addition of three two-bedroom apartments above the existing home.
