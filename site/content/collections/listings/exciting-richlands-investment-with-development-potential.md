This recently renovated two-bedroom family home boasts a fresh kitchen, bathroom and lovely living and entertaining spaces. To the rear of the property is an un-renovated large, freestanding, fully self-contained granny flat of similar construction to the main house. This is an ideal property for growing families and investors alike, with plenty of exciting opportunities to capitalise on your investment.

This is a solid home with cavity brick internal walls and iron roof. Situated on a 607sqm LMR zoned block, this property also represents an exciting investment in the addition of three two-bedroom apartments above the existing home. Investors please be aware that appropriate Brisbane City Council checks and approvals would need to be made to ensure the current structure is suitable for this development. Richlands is a rapidly developing industrial area, which will require additional housing development in the future to meet with rising demand.

Features include:
*  Full renovation of the home internally
*  Extra-large master bedroom
*  Beautiful functional kitchen with granite bench-tops, stainless steel appliances and plenty of storage
*  Large dining and living area with open brick fireplace
