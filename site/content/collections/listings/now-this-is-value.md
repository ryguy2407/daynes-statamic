Positioned at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, this gated complex offers a unique blend of resort-style living with the Tuscan-inspired architecture, beautifully landscaped grounds, sparkling swimming pool and access to the canal for all your boating activities.

The Gold Coast will be at your doorstep. A 5-10 minute walk will see you at Nobby Beach and the local surf club. If you are after fine dining, the Nobby Beach restaurant precinct is just around the corner. The Pacific Fair Shopping Centre is only a 5 minute car or bus ride away.

The house itself is a stand-alone villa - a rarity so close to the beach. Well maintained, it has been designed with flexible living in mind and would suit families, retirees, professional couples or anyone looking for a low maintenance property with much of the work looked after the on-site manager.

The spacious open plan living area opens onto your very own private courtyard area to extend your living space. A modern kitchen, three double bedrooms with built-ins, a large family bathroom and ensuite complete the picture. Air conditioning in the living area and ceiling fans in the bedrooms will keep you cool all year around.

Property features;
- A unique stand-alone villa on a 450sqm block (a rarity so close to the beach)

- Master bedroom with its own ensuite and access to private courtyard
