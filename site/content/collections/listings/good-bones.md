This high-set home holds the potential to be transformed into a lovely family home. Situated privately back from the road with an elevated outlook, this property is full of natural light and lovely breezes. Almost completely original interiors have been lovingly cared for and obviously the place of many happy shared memories. An addition to the original home is the beautiful timber deck overlooking the fruit trees in the backyard. Perfect for celebrating a long summers evening with family and friends, this deck is an entertainers delight.

The original timber floors are showcased in the open plan kitchen, living and dining. The living has been cleverly expanded by converting the third bedroom into a study nook and large storage for the master bedroom. Easily reverted back to the original floor plan, the existing layout is a clever modification for those who need a little extra from their living spaces. Despite requiring cosmetic upgrades, this home has great bones and would be a great property to move in and renovate at your own pace. Likewise, a sound investment for those looking to add to their property portfolio, with rental demands still strong in the area.

This property features:

*  Beautiful original timber floors throughout living, kitchen, hallway and bedrooms
*  Open plan kitchen, living and dining with study to the side
*  Stepping through to spacious timber deck overlooking mature fruit trees in yard
*  Carpeted sunroom to the front of the home
*  Two bedrooms, master with large storage area
*  Family bathroom with small bathtub/shower combination and separate toilet
*  New roof

Situated on a 549sqm almost completely flat block at the southern end of Beatty Road. This property has great convenience for those who commute or work in the surrounding industrial areas.
