I am a lovely post war home perched on a massive 809sqm block. My features and attributes include:

  -   Three large bedrooms with built-ins
  -   New kitchen with stainless steel appliances
  -   New bathroom with massive shower and gorgeous fittings
  -   Sensational hardwood timber floors
  -   Potential to raise me and build under
  -   Free standing two car garage with workshop with power and water
  -   Carport to the side with roller door
  -   Separate toilet
  -   I am fully fenced
  -   I have a lovely paved BBQ area to the rear of me

However, alternatively you may consider developing me, splitting me in half and remodeling me
Call me now as I am hot property and won't be available for long!
I am a terrific catch at offers over $440,000
