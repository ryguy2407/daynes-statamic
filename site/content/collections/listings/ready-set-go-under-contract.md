Located close to all amenities including shops, a large park, Acacia Ridge and Watson Road State Schools. A bus stop is situated approximately 300 metres away.

This house needs very little money spent on it as it has always been well cared for, however, new carpet and an internal repaint will maximise the value of this property at minimal expense.

Rent return would be in the vicinity of $400pw.
