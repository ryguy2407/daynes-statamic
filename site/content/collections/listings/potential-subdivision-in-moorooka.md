It's not everyday you get the opportunity to secure a huge 1037sqm block in Moorooka.

Currently on the property is a three bedroom postwar home built in 1948. Possibly demolish and build a new home or perhaps subdivide the block

- The block backs onto lovely parkland which leads onto the Moorooka Sports and Community Club
- Residential A zoning
- Close to Woolworths and other shops in Moorooka and bus services
- Only about 6km to the CBD

Priced at $565,000
