Here we have a lowset brick and tile 2 bedroom house in the heart of Salisbury and only 11 kms from the CBD. It is situated on a 602sqm corner allotment with 2 street frontages.

The house is very solid due to the internal walls being built from double brick construction and the floors are tiled throughout.

It has a large study area to the rear of the home leading out to a single garage and additional large lockable room for the use of storage or a recreation area.

The living area has an A/C unit plus ceiling fans.

The property may be able to be subdivided into 2 x 300sqm blocks under the new town plan for Salisbury however this would require you to make your own inquiries with the Brisbane City Council to see if in fact this could be done.

The property will require some work but it presents its self as a great opportunity to enter into the property market either to live in or to invest.

Location;
* Bus stop on same street - 30 second walk
* Salisbury train station - 2 minute drive
* Walk to Salisbury Bowls Club, cafe & shops on Ainsworth Street
* ALDI Shopping Centre - 2 minute drive
* Salisbury Primary School - 2 minute walk
* Also in very close proximity to Griffith University, Sunnybank shopping centres, Westfield Garden City and QEII Hospital
* Those that live in Salisbury will tell you how convenient it is!
